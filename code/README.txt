Turbine is a runtime library that supports distributed execution of
task-parallel data-flow-based applications. It depends directly on:
 * lb, a distributed MPI-based load balancer and data-store
 * c-utils, for data structures and other utilities

Turbine is developed as part of the ExM project.  For further details on
ExM, visit http://exm.xstack.org
